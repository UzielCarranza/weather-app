# "Weather App: My First Development Project"

As a front-end development enthusiast, I'm thrilled to present my first development project - a weather app that showcases my passion for the front-end and my persistence to learn and improve. This weather app is built using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript technologies, providing a seamless user experience for all.

One of the key features of this weather app is the search bar that integrates with a map API, allowing users to search for a specific city and display its weather. The app also provides the option to display weather based on the user's current location, making it easy for users to quickly access the weather information they need.

This weather app is a testament to my love for front-end development and my dedication to continuously improving my skills. I am excited to see what the future holds for this project and for my development journey.
